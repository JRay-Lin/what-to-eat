This project was inspired by Jia's blog post [(link)](https://blog.jiatool.com/posts/foodpanda_spider/) about foodpanda's API.

It uses the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` hook and [Delivery Hero's API](https://developers.deliveryhero.com) to get all the restaurants nearby , and choose one for you.  

  
In addition, the API response also give the type of restaurants', so you can specify what kind of food you want.

*Currently, the app is only available in traditional Chinese, English version is still under development.*
